# Pokedex
Creation of a website that allows users to interactively explore Pokémon.

## 🧢⚡ Welcome to my Pokédex project! ⚡🧢

This page is the result of a “basic” (but very fun!) exercise where I trained my Pokémon skills in **async/await to fetch** data from an API. Along the way, it also became a great playground to practice **DOM manipulation** and see everything come to life on screen.

I honestly had a blast building this project. Of course, it could be pushed further (more animations, more interactions, more polish) but as with every project, you have to stop somewhere… otherwise you’d keep leveling up forever 😉

To avoid going full Pokémon Master on this one, I set myself a few clear **objectives**:

- Fetch data from the Pokémon API (which is incredibly rich and fun to explore)

- Display selected data in a clean and attractive way

- Use DOM functions to show, hide, and interact with the content

- Apply basic CSS concepts to make everything visually pleasant

If you check out the final result, I hope you have fun exploring it... and maybe even feel a little wave of nostalgia for the classic Pokémon era

**Gotta code ’em all!**
